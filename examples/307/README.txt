This archive contains solutions made for the TON Smart-contract implementation contest.
Contents are laid out in the folders as the following:
	0-Definition: the definition of tasks and guidelines for the work.
	2-DNS-Auto: TON DNS Resolver smart contract with automatic registration upon recieving of some internal messages.
	3-DNS-Man: TON DNS Resolver smart contract with manual registration controlled by signed external messages.
	8-Bonus: UDL files for Notepad++ to be able to see the sources a bit more beautifully.
	9-Rubbish: first version of MultiSig smart contract in which I employed self-made 4-search trees instead of using built in dicts. May be interesting to look at because of implementation of those 4-ST in FunC and process of their building in Fift. Also contains intermediary test data used for online testing of contracts' implementation.

Please refer to the Documentation.pdf and/or Documentation.docx files in the root folder for through documentation on all the entries.
